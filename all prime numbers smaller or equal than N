/*Develop a C code that gets a positive number N and prints out all prime numbers smaller or equal than N.

Hint: You need a loop that iterates a candidate from 2 to N. 
for each candidate, calculate the number of divisors of that candidate
(similar to the code attached) and if that number of divisors is 2, announce the candidate as a Prime number.

Sample run:
Enter a positive number: 10
2 3 5 7
Enter a positive number: 20
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19*/
